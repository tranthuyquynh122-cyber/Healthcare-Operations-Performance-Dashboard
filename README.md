## 📂 Dataset Description & Data Structure
The dataset contains anonymized patient visit records, including admission and discharge dates, departments, and service types.

**Key metrics include:**
- Total patient visits  
- Average length of stay (LOS)
- Visits by department  
- Time-based visit trends  

Data was cleaned and standardized to ensure reliable analysis.

## 🔎 Final Conclusion & Recommendations
- Patient visit volume shows clear time-based patterns  
- Several departments consistently handle higher workloads  
- Peak periods highlight potential capacity and resource pressure  

**Recommendations:**
- Monitor high-volume departments for capacity planning  
- Use peak-period insights to optimize staffing and resources  
- Track LOS trends to detect operational bottlenecks early
